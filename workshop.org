#+TITLE: GNU Radio Workshop

* Welcome
  5 minutes
** Who are we?
** What's the plan for today?


* Intro Presentation
   30 mintues
** GNU Radio
   - real-time signal processing framework for use in SDRs
   - GNU Radio is the software part of a GPP-based SDR 
   - Open Source
   - Large community
   - Compatible with most HW
   - Modular and easy to adapt to specific use
   - It's not the application, but the framework/base components to
     build an application
** Flow Graph
** Blocks
** Streaming
** Async Messages
** GRC
** GUI Controls
   - note the difference between
     - GRC to graphically configure the flow graph
     - QT to add graphcial controls to the application
   - show what's possible with QT, but don't give details (-> RDS GUI)
** GNU Radio applications
   - RDS (simple extension of GNU Radio with a custom panel)
   - GQRX (sophisticated application w/ GNU Radio under the hood)
** OOTs
   - Huge library of modules
   - CGRAN lists them
   - PyBombs helps to install them
** GNU Radio is an Ecosystem
   - more then a SDR library/framework
   - large Open Source community
   - GNU Radio foundation
   - GNU Radio conference
   - Activities like GSoC, SOCIS, R&S Engineering Competition
   - used BY academia, industry, government, hobbyists, ...
   - used FOR DSP, security, ham radio, radio astronomy, rapid
     prototyping, ...

* Using GNU Radio: FM Receiver
   30 mintues
   Build your own FM transceiver

   - Put in Osmocom source (-> works with all HW)
   - Use variables for sample rate and gain
   - Pipe source in GUI Sinks (Waterfall, Frequency, Time domain)
   - Use GUI Hints to arrange them nicer
   - Replace variables with Slider
   - Use Control Panel to change appearance
   - Connect NB FM Receiver and Audio Sink
   - Adapt sample rate
     - down sample before FM Receiver
     - use exact sample rate of SDR
     - experiment with parameters to avoid audio under runs
   - Demonstrate Parameter block
** TODO what's our advice regarding audio underruns


* Using OOTs: APRS
   30 minutes


* Extending GNU Radio w/ Custom OOT
   30 mintues


* Misc
** TODO Check if there are good introductory slides available (Marcus or Tom maybe)
** TODO Make Introductory Slides
** TODO Make slides for hands-on part
** TODO Idea for custom OOT module
** TODO Search and test APRS module
** TODO Prepare Live Image
** TODO Test Live Image on different PCs and w/ different HW
